"""The terminal's queue of messages waiting for their turn.

One list, read by the turn runner (vision/cli.py drain_turns: the next message goes when the reply
ends) and by the queued strip over the input box (vision/ui.py), where ↑ picks a message to edit or
remove. While a message is being picked or edited the queue is held: nothing is sent, so an
edited message goes back in its own place rather than behind the next one.
