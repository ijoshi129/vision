"""The supervisor: launches agents for the front end and enforces the policy in code, not in a prompt.

The conversation model never runs anything itself. When a request is delegated (by the router, or by
the model asking for it) the supervisor:

- checks the agent and model against the allowlist in `[router.agents]` and the effort against what
  that model supports (nothing is swapped for something else: an unavailable choice is an error the
  user sees);
- builds the worker (the same task-mode brain the voice conversation always used) on a copy of the
  session's brain config, with the approval-only commands in `[router.permissions]` added to its deny
  rules until the user grants one;
- runs the task on a thread with the `[router.limits]` timeout, tracks the run's state
  (queued → starting → running → waiting_for_user | completed | failed | cancelled | timed_out),
  keeps the worker's own session id so a question is answered in the same session, and stops a run
  that keeps asking or has written more than its token budget;
- refuses to launch the same task twice (a retry of the same request returns the run already made);
- writes one line per decision to ~/.local/state/vision/routing.jsonl, with the request redacted.

A result is only ever what the worker's structured result said (vision/delegation.py): a run that
did not return a valid `completed` result is not completed, whatever the worker wrote in prose.
