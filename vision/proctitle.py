"""Make the process look like `vision`, not `/…/.venv/bin/python -m vision`.

Terminals label their tabs with the foreground process. Ptyxis appends ` — <cmdline>` to the title
unless the command line is empty, and it turns every NUL in /proc/<pid>/cmdline into a space, so even
`claude` (one word plus its terminator) picks up a suffix. The only way to get a bare tab title is an
empty command line: overwrite argv[0] with NUL and set the last byte of the argv area to something
else, which flips the kernel's /proc reader into setproctitle(3) mode and reports just "". `comm`
is set to `vision` so ps/top show `[vision]`. Python has long since copied sys.argv, so nothing
inside the interpreter notices.
